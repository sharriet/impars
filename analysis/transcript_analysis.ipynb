    "### First impressions\n",
    "These are some first impressions which are not organised by theme.\n",
    "- Agile misrepresentation\n",
    "    + Negative assosiations and possible misunderstanding/lack of knowledge surrounding agile PM (PC)\n",
    "    + Bad past experience working in agile environment (PF)\n",
    "- Stakeholder analysis\n",
    "    + Does the PM tend to have less power and influence than you'd typically find in an industry project? \n",
    "    + Do developers have more power and less accountability?\n",
    "- Team models\n",
    "    + Likely to encounter disparate teams ('sharded teams') which are really sub-teams and not really related to one another (e.g. collaborating institutions)\n",
    "    + Teams with absent PI and/or PM ('leaderless teams'). Original grant writer may not be involved.\n",
    "    + Teams where PhDs essentially work independently 'not-really-a-team team'\n",
    "    + PH interacted less as an academic than they do in their role as a laboratory engineer\n",
    "    + Individuals contributing to different repos\n",
    "    + The PI isn't necessarily the best manager. Give roles based on experience and competence, not hierarchy.\n",
    "    + Some evidence major decisions made by individuals without consulting a team (PF)\n",
    "    + Some teams recruited on dev experience, others on research familiarity or personal connection/convenience (i.e. PhD students, post-docs). Depending on the project and its aims, the latter approach may be ill-advised.\n",
    "    + The power developers have might become inflated, particularly when their role in the research is blurred. Typically devs will have high interest lower power, whereas a PM and SME will have both high power and interest. Without formal PM structure the devs will tend to hold more power.\n",
    "- Values\n",
    "    + Open-source is important. Monetisation (of software) is not normally a consideration. Software more of a by-product than a commodity?\n",
    "    + To think critically about collaborative working and processes does not seem to come naturally. They tended to use positive language about the projects and regarded them as successful.\n",
    "    + Tendency not to think too much about process. PA notes the contrast when an industry PM was involved ('proper release process', 'understanding requirements', 'respect for working in teams') PN seems to suggest that the details matter much. On a large project it's possible to spin it in a positive light, whereas each increment of work is not open to scrutiny.\n",
    "    + How well a cross-partnership team functions does not seem to be a factor in relation to future funding. Is there an incentive to establish effective long-term partnerships?\n",
    "    + Develop to a point and then handover to a commerical partner or create spinoff. Sense that anything long-term or viable as an end product is futile. Support research, not income generating.\n",
    "    + Motivated by desire to do good work with other experts (PE, PC).\n",
    "    + Motivated by desire to learn, collaborate and write papers. Doesn't want to manage or be a business brain (PE)\n",
    "    + Not much motivation to challenge processes. The fact they will typically receive 'excellent' with no detailed feedback at the end of the project won't help to encourgae this mindset.\n",
    "- Challenges\n",
    "    + WPs designed up front by someone who may be wholly absent after sign-off\n",
    "    + Deliverables may be very loosely defined (exploratory research)\n",
    "    + Project may consist of teams who are working on different WPs that really have very little to do with one another\n",
    "    + There may be virtually no collaboration there post-award. They may develop independent incompatible software.\n",
    "    + Related to previous, seems difficult for multiple projects to result in a shared infrastructure\n",
    "    + Post-Docs just off PhD may be used to being 'free')\n",
    "    + Decisions being made by one person and not open to being challenged (e.g. choice of development language)\n",
    "    + Managing cost of context change when working on several projects or juggling teaching commitments\n",
    "    + An entire project may be founded (more-or-less) on an assumption because it isn't possible to prototype first\n",
    "    + Turning the desire to make tools people will find useful into research - is it hard to fund otherwise?\n",
    "    + Making software sustainable. Make decisions assuming someone else will take this on after you. Avoiding dependencies. Reliable, scable infrastructure.\n",
    "    + Engaging SMEs seems to be a challenge. Hard to uncover and align interests. Perhaps a collaborator should not be chosen unless there is a clear alignment there? (PN)\n",
    "    + Working with startups may make partner engagement easier in some instances as they have more to gain? (PO)\n",
    "    + Funding ongoing maintenence. Grants too short-term. Need a collaborative approach to keep useful projects alive? (PF,PC)\n",
    "    + Difficult to make comparisons as projects tended to meet acceptance criteria, although that throws up some interesting questions (things have to look good on paper).\n",
    "    + Greater commitment and accountability needed to ensure short-term goals are met/tasks completed on time. Suggestion this relates to having clearly defined tasks with due dates and commitment to deliver. When people don't interact frequently or there is no personal connection, it is harder to generate that sense of responsibility/urgency. (PK, PO)\n",
    "- Tools and processes\n",
    "    + Tools are used for reporting and tracking issues and bugs, version control also common\n",
    "    + Not much evidence of planned processes. Typically organic, ad-hoc. Progress tracking/task management tools seldom reported although KANBAN was mentioned a couple of times.\n",
    "    + Testing is not mentioned that frequently. Testing is thought to be the number one form of quality control.\n",
    "- Domain-specific observations    \n",
    "    + In field of maths, algorithms and software is where the research has impact.\n",
    "    + In science, everyone has to write scripts. Differentiates between scripts and software (PN)\n",
    "- Quantifying success\n",
    "    + Inherently difficult. Once a project makes it through the application process and is 'approved' for funding, it cannot really fail. Depending  on the funding source and PO there may be more or less scrutiny of the deliverables, but if it makes it to completion it is essentially successful.\n",
    "    + Projects no longer graded yet multiples participants reported having 'excellent' grades. Suspect this doesn't mean an awful lot?\n",
    "    + There is no unified metric for success. There are various we can look at but they cannot be applied consistently across projects (things like follow-up funding aren't always applicable). Hence subjective interpretations and 'reading between the lines' is probably the best measure we can get. I will create a composite success metric and I expect they will all come out relatively high.\n",
    "- Review process\n",
    "    + Viewed as a positive, important process though not without problems. There was a general sense that the more rigourous review process of an EU project benefited the projects, as opposed to the more relaxed review process associated with UKRI funded projects.\n",
    "    + Reviewers not critical enough / not enough attention to detail / interested in different things. Possibly related to the fact WPs are lengthy, reviews infrequent, so there is potential for detail to be neglected.\n",
    "    + Inconsistent / unpredictable 'auditors'. Possibly related to the experience level of the PO, but sometimes their impartiality was questioned (PC).\n",
    "    + Some need to separate general project process from software project process and understand the relation?"

    "### Network visualisation\n",
    "See network_analysis.py script. The betweenness centrality has been used to control the size of the nodes. Interestingly, betweenness tells a slightly different story to the count plot above. It tells us more about co-occurrences of themes across the population ('themes in common'), whereas the bar chart above doesn't take into account the likelihood that a given theme may be picked up several times in a single interview. In the network plot, the thickness of the edge correlates to the number of mentions (i.e. thick line means theme was strong in a specific interview). Processes was not the most common theme, but it was a strong theme in several interviews. Resources seems to have been the most common theme. \n",
    "### Stakeholder analysis\n",
    "Analysis all of the power vs interest matrices and deriving an 'average/aggregate' version to compare with a 'typical' commercial one is interesting as it adds weight to the argument that developers tend to have more power on research software projects. This isn't necessarily bad as there was often a distinction made between 'researcher developers' and 'normal developers', the latter being less invested, however it can backfire (as in G/K). By contrast, PMs seem to have less power and interest than one might expect, which is consistent with what participants reported. The PM may be a more distant, sdministrative figure? It is not necessarily a problem not to have a very involved PM, but what is there instead? Who is there to resolve problems and disputes? Funding bodies are the closest one gets to 'Sponsors' but they seem to have less power."

Showing this has been done could add another layer of confidence to proposals? On large consortiums consultancy might also involve an architect who can help partners to plan how parallel streams of a large software project will be integrated.\n",
    "2. Team building - At start of a project and perhaps at intervals, someone independent builds and reviews team processes, reports to PI. Non-beurocratic, more about managing human interactions etc. Scaled appropriately for project. Could help PhD students and others used to working alone to prepare for more collaborative roles.\n",
    "3. Out-sourcing - in some instances, could a software project be out-sourced to another entity? Like an STFC for software. What sort of projects? Maybe ones involving GUIs/general users? An inter-institutional RSE group?\n",
