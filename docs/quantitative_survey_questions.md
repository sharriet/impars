# Quantitative survey questions

Responses to these questions by developers and key stakeholders (i.e. funders, end-users) will be used to quantify the relative 'success' of projects within the same funding call. 

The questions shall relate to the following success metrics:

+ Technical performance (i.e. the quality of the end product)
+ Efficiency of execution (i.e. was it delivered on time and within budget)
+ Personal growth (i.e. the benefits perceived by individual developers)
+ Stakeholder satisfaction

NB: Some of these questions can be answered from open data sources.

+ How much funding did the project receive? (from data)
+ Over what time scale was the project funded? (from data)
+ How would you describe the initial deadline imposed on this project?
+ How would you rate the completeness of the project at the initial deadline?
+ Was the initial budget met?
+ Were the outputs and production processes different from those anticipated by the initial budget?
+ Did the project deliverables meet the acceptance criteria? (i.e. did it meet some predefined requirements)
+ How would you rate the quality of the deliverables relative to what you initially set out to achieve?
+ (Stakeholders only) How would you rate your satisfaction with the project outcomes?
+ (Developers only) How would you rate your learning on this project?
+ (Developers only) How would you rate the impact of this project on your professional development?
