# Case study interviews

## About the interviews

The following questions are designed to encourage you to reflect on your project processes and management style in detail.

It is important that you answer the questions as honestly as possible.

Here are some additional guidelines we'd like you to be aware of:

+ It is not necessary to give a single definitive response to a question. For example, you might have competing opinions on a topic. That is allowed. You are free to explore whatever feelings you have about a project, regardless of how positive or cynical they are.
+ It is fine to go off on tangents. At times your mind might wander onto something that doesn't seem obviously connected. Don't let that stop you from exploring that idea. The interviewer will pull you back if necessary.
+ Occasionally the interviewer may skip a question if they feel it has already been answered, or they may add additional questions to encourage deeper reflection or elaboration of a particular point. Please do not be worried by this.
+ If at any point you are unsure how to answer a question, please tell the interviewer. Either they will try to reframe the question, or they will skip it and move on.
+ You will notice that pens and paper are available at the interview. Please feel free to use them as a communication aid where applicable. Occasionally you may be prompted to do so by the interviewer.
+ Don't worry about revealing identifiable characteristics of the project through your narrative. If the details are deemed relevant enough 

## Example questions

+ What do you think were the success criteria for the project?
+ How was the project funded and are you able to say roughly how much was allocated and over what time scale? (ranges is fine)
	+ e.g. Â£1-2 million over 5 years, from UKRI council
+ Outline the roles and responsibilities of those involved in the project.
+ Could you depict their involvement on a timeline?
+ Who were the other stakeholders involved in the project? (e.g. research council, HoD, the public etc.)
+ Where would you position each of the stakeholders on the Power vs Interest chart?
+ How regularly did you communicate with each of the stakeholders you've identified and via what means?
+ What was involved in the planning of the project?
+ What tools or methodologies did you use to manage workflow and keep track of the work?
+ What did your own work pattern look like while on the project? For example, how much time did you allocate to it in a typical week?
+ Were there any extended periods over which the project was either completely inactive or you were not contributing to it?
+ Do you think the project was successful?
+ If you were to start the project again under the same external conditions, is there anything you would change about your own contributions, or any ways you might try to influence others? ('external conditions' is meant to imply 'factors beyond your direct control')
+ If you were able to restart the project under different external conditions, what would those conditions ideally be? Are there any ways you might influence them?

## How we intend to preserve anonymity

+ Identifying characteristics of a project or individual will not be reported
+ Data may be paraphrased and/or aggregated to avoid 'deductive' identification
+ Voice recordings, diagrams and anything handwritten during the interview will be destroyed after the information has been extrapolated

## Right to withdraw

Participants in this study reserve the right to withdraw at any time without needing to give a reason.

This would result in the complete removal of your unpublished response data from our records.

Aggregated data that has already been published would remain in the public domain.
