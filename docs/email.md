Dear [PINAME],

I am an academic at [Leeds Trinity University] and fellow of the Software Sustainability Institute. I am very interested in academic software development processes and am contacting you to invite you to take part in a study called IMPARS (Impact of Management and Process on Academic Research Software).

The study aims to improve our understanding of common problems linked to the project process and explain their potential impact on project success indicators.

You are someone I would like to talk to due to your involvement with the [FUNDING CALL] [PROJECTNAME] which I believe included software among its outputs. I am also keen to talk to other members of the team who were involved with the software element(s) of the project should you be willing to connect us.

Your participation in this research would involve taking part in a one-to-one interview at your institution or over a web-based video conferencing platform. You may also be asked to complete a short electronic survey after the interview. Your participation in this research would be anonymous.

You are invited to find out more about the the project and interview format via the [IMPARS web pages](https://sharriet.github.io/impars/). There you may also access sample [interview](https://sharriet.github.io/impars/docs/case_study_questions.md) and [electronic survey](https://sharriet.github.io/impars/docs/quantitative_survey_questions.md) questions. 

If you are willing to participate or have any further questions, please respond to this email.


I hope to hear from you soon.

Yours Sincerely,

Dr Sorrel Harriet, SSI Fellow 2019
